#TweetSweep
TweetSweep is a web tool to make cleaning up communities more social, more connected, and more digital, allowing local groups, schools, and activists to identify where trash is and focus their efforts.

##How it works
Wweet a picture of some trash with the hashtag #TweetSweep679 and it's location will show up on the app which you can open up to see what tweets have been made and where.
